        <p style="text-align: justify">
          I am a web developer with one year of experience. I am currently a
          B.Tech student at Graphic Era Deemed to be University. I have a strong
          interest in data science and machine learning, and I have used these
          skills to complete two projects: Twitter Sentimental Analysis and
          Driver Drowsiness Detection. In the Twitter Sentimental Analysis
          project, I used natural language processing to analyze tweets and
          determine their sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). In the
          Driver Drowsiness Detection project, I used computer vision to detect
          drowsiness in drivers. I am a quick learner and I am always eager to
          take on new challenges. I am also a team player and I am able to work
          independently.
